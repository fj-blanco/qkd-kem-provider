# QKD-KEM Provider

This fork implements hybrid key encapsulation mechanisms combining quantum key distribution (QKD) with post-quantum cryptography in OpenSSL 3.0. The implementation extends the [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) to enable concurrent use of QKD-derived keys alongside post-quantum KEM operations.

For build instructions and usage details, see the oqs-provider [0.7.0 README](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/0.7.0/README.md).
